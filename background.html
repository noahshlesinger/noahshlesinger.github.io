                    <h>How I ended up in Triathlon</h>
                    <p>It was the fall of 2019 whenI fell in love with Triathlon and all of its complexities. However, it wasnâ€™t until 2022 that I finally committed myself fully to the sport. In June of last year, I left my engineering job in pursuit of becoming a high-performance athlete and competing at the top level of triathlon. That month I joined the JP Elite Triathlon squad and finished the season with a podium at IM 70.3 Waco. The following winter I broke my collarbone and had to spend the next 6 months rehabbing my shoulder and getting back to good fitness. I managed to rehab in time to compete in IM 70.3 Oregon that July where I finished 3rd again. 

                    </p><p> Not quite the season I was hoping for with so much of the year affected by my injury. However, I am now working harder than ever before as I get into 25 hours of training per week. I now turn my eyes to our Florida training camp and the rest of the season with cautious optimism.
