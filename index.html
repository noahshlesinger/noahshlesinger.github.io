            <p>In his senior year at the University fo California, Davis, Noah joined his school's triathlon team and took 7th in his first sprint distance race. He followed this showing with 11th at Cal Berkeley's draft legal sprint, 9th at Tritonman's non-draft sprint, and just as he was hitting his stride in the winter of 2020 with a top 5 finish at Stanford's draft legal sprint race, Covid 19 overtook the world and the rest of the season was cancelled.<br><br>He set aside his triathlon dreams to pursue a career in engineering. 2 years later, he left his job and joined JP Elite, a highly competitive pro team under the guidance of the 2020 USA Triathlon Elite Development Coach of the Year: James Petersen. After 4 weeks on the team, Noah scored a top 30 finish at his first 70.3 distance triathlon and beating 1/3 of the pro field in the swim with just 2 years of swimming.<br><br>Currently, Noah is training for a podium at Age Group Nationals Olympic and Sprint distances in Milwaukee on his way to earning his elite license. From there, he starts the long march to the top of the United States rankings and a spot on USA's Olympic team for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games.</p>
