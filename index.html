            <p>In his senior year at the University of California, Davis, Noah joined his college's triathlon team and took 7th in his first sprint distance race. He followed this showing with an 11th place at Cal Berkeley's draft legal sprint, 9th at Tritonman's non-draft sprint, and just as he was hitting his stride in the winter of 2020 with a top 5 finish at Stanford's draft legal sprint race, Covid 19 was introduced to the world and the rest of the season was cancelled.<br><br>After graduating, he set aside triathlon to pursue a career in engineering. Within a few months, the itch to train came on strong and he began working towards a 2021 season. Feeling as though he couldn't offer his job and his triaining 100% of his attention, he decided to leave his job at the end of 2021. 6 months later in June of 2022, Noah joined JP Elite, a highly competitive pro team under the guidance of the 2020 USA Triathlon Elite Development Coach of the Year: James Petersen. After 4 weeks on the team, Noah scored a top 30 finish at his first competitive 70.3 distance triathlon and beat 1/3 of the men's pro field in the swim with just 2 years of swimming experience.<br><br>Currently, Noah is training for a podium at Age Group Nationals Olympic and Sprint distances in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on his way to earning his elite license. From there, he will start the long march to the top of the United States rankings and earn a spot on USA's Olympic team for the 2028 Los Angeles Olympic Games.</p>
